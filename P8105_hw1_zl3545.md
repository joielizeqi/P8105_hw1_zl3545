# Problem 1

## Load data set

``` r
data("penguins",
     package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The “penguins” data set contains a tibble data frame with the following
variables that describe the penguins: species, island, bill_length_mm,
bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year.

The tibble data frame contains 344 rows and 8 columns of data.

The mean flipper length for these penguins is 200.9152047 mm.

## Plot data

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = flipper_length_mm,
                     color = species)) + geom_point()
```

## Save the above scatterplot

``` r
ggsave(filename = "flipper_length_vs_bill_length_scatterplot.png")
```

# Problem 2

## Create a data frame

Create a data frame with the following variables:

- `sample`: a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal
  distribution.

- `pos`: a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
  greater than 0.

- `chr`: a character vector of length 10.

- `fct`: a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”.

``` r
df = tibble(sample = rnorm(10),
            pos = sample > 0,
            chr = c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'),
            fct = factor(c("L1", "L1", "L1", "L2", "L2", "L2", "L2", "L3", "L3", "L3")))
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    sample pos   chr   fct  
    ##     <dbl> <lgl> <chr> <fct>
    ##  1  1.92  TRUE  a     L1   
    ##  2  1.62  TRUE  b     L1   
    ##  3  0.823 TRUE  c     L1   
    ##  4  3.40  TRUE  d     L2   
    ##  5 -0.785 FALSE e     L2   
    ##  6 -0.498 FALSE f     L2   
    ##  7  0.953 TRUE  g     L2   
    ##  8  0.599 TRUE  h     L3   
    ##  9  0.847 TRUE  i     L3   
    ## 10 -1.81  FALSE j     L3

## Taking the mean of each variable

``` r
sample_mean = mean(pull(df, sample))
pos_mean = mean(pull(df, pos))
chr_mean = mean(pull(df, chr))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, chr)): argument is not numeric or logical:
## returning NA
fct_mean = mean(pull(df, fct))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, fct)): argument is not numeric or logical:
## returning NA
```

The mean of the `sample` variable in this data frame is 0.7072032. The
mean of the `pos` variable in this data frame is 0.7. We cannot take the
mean of the `chr` and the `fct` variables because of their data types.

## Converting data types

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df, pos))
as.numeric(pull(df, chr))
as.numeric(pull(df, fct))
```

When we tried to convert the data type of `pos`, `chr`, and `fct` into
numerical types, only `pos` (a logical variable) and `fct` (a factor
variable) were successfully converted.

Logical variables can be converted into numerics based on the rules that
`TRUE == 1` and `FALSE == 0`, so the numerics `0` and `1` were coerced
to `pos` when we applied `mean()` and `as.numeric()`.

Factor variables are stored as integers internally, but they typically
represent categorical data instead of having numerical meanings. When we
applied `as.numeric()` to `fct`, the internal integers were coerced to
`fct`. But applying `mean()` on `fct` generated `NA` because R does not
automatically coerce numerics onto factor variables.

Applying `mean()` and `as.numeric()` on the `chr` variable generated
`NA` because character variables do not have numerical meanings in R and
R cannot coerce numerics onto character variables.
